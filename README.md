# Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model

This repository contains a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model developed using Python and popular NLP libraries. The model is trained to identify and classify named entities in text data.

Named Entity Recognition is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc., in unstructured text.

## Features

- Trained custom NER model for identifying named entities in text.
- Support for identifying common named entity types such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
- Flexible and easily adaptable to new domain-specific named entity types.
- Preprocessing utilities for cleaning and preparing text data for NER.
- Evaluation metrics for measuring the performance of the NER model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/girijabalaji/custom_ner_model.git
   cd custom-ner-model
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your training data by organizing text data and their corresponding named entity annotations in a suitable format.

2. Train the custom NER model using the provided training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/training/data --output_model /path/to/save/model
   ```

   This script will preprocess the data, train the NER model, and save the trained model to the specified output path.

3. Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation script:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --data_path /path/to/evaluation/data --model_path /path/to/saved/model
   ```

   This script will evaluate the performance of the NER model on the provided evaluation data and display metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it for predicting named entities in new text data. Utilize the provided `predict_entities()` function in the `predict.py` script:

   ```python
   from predict import predict_entities

   text = "Some text with named entities."
   model_path = "/path/to/saved/model"

   entities = predict_entities(text, model_path)
   print(entities)
   ```

   The function takes the input text and the path to the saved model as arguments, and returns a list of predicted named entities in the text.

## Customization

You can customize and extend the functionality of the custom NER model according to your specific requirements. Here are some possible customizations:

- Add support for additional named entity types by extending the entity annotation scheme and training the model with labeled data.
- Modify the preprocessing steps to handle specific text data characteristics or perform additional text cleaning and normalization.
- Implement post-processing steps to refine the predicted named entities or resolve potential ambiguities.
